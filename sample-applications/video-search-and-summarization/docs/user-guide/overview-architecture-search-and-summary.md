# Video Search and Summary Architecture Overview

The page provides a technical overview of the Video Search and Summary application combined mode architecture, components, and extensibility. The documentation builds on top of the documentation of video search and video summarization capability in individual mode and highlights how the components are reused to realize the combined mode.

## Approach
The system architecture diagram shows the Video Search and Summary pipeline and its constituent components. All the components across video search and video summary is used to realize the combined mode. Following is a high-level overview of the components.

1. **Video Search and Summary UI**: A reference UI is provided for users to interact with and exercise all capabilities of the video search and summary application, including video upload, search queries, and summary viewing.

2. **Video pipeline manager**: The pipeline manager is the central orchestrator of both search and summary pipelines. It receives requests from the UI and coordinates the microservices to deliver unified search and summary capabilities. It provides asynchronous handling of video processing while simultaneously creating embeddings for search indexing.

3. **Video Ingestion**: This microservice is responsible for ingesting videos that need to be both summarized and indexed for search. The ingestion microservice is based on Intel DLStreamer pipeline and utilises the DLStreamer pipeline server (DLSPS) to manage the video pipeline. The video ingestion microservice allows ingestion of common video formats. The ingestion microservice creates video chunks, extracts configured frames from it, passes the frame(s) through object detection and outputs all of the metadata and the video chunks to the object store.

4. **Multimodal Embedding Generation**: The embedding microservice generates vector representations of video content - frames summary, captions summary, and audio transcriptions. The vector representations enables the semantic search capabilities. These embeddings are created in parallel with the summary generation process and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

5. **VLM as the captioning block**: The VLM microservice is responsible for generating captions for the specific video chunk. The VLM accepts prompts which also includes additional information from configured capabilities (like object detection) and generates the caption. The caption information is stored to the object store and also used for embedding generation.

6. **LLM as the summarizer of captions**: The LLM microservice is used to generate the summary of the individual captions. It is configurable if to use LLM or the VLM to generate such summaries.

7. **Audio transcription**: The Audio transcription microservice helps create a transcription of the audio channel in the given video. The extracted audio transcription serves as another source of rich metadata that can be used both as an input to VLM and separately as text data to enrich the summary and search capabilities.

8. **Vector Database and Search**: A vector database stores the multimodal embeddings and enables fast semantic search across the video collection. Users can search for videos using natural language queries that are matched against video content semantically.

Video Search and Summary application is a unified pipeline that provides both semantic search and summarization capabilities to meet different deployment requirements. The capabilities ensure a rich contextual and perceptual analysis of video during both the search indexing and summary process, thereby providing qualitatively richer search results and summaries of the given video collection. The figures below illustrate the setup. The Video Search and Summary UI communicates with the pipeline manager microservice to upload videos for processing, perform semantic searches across the video collection, and view summaries. The UI allows users to configure the specific capabilities required in both search and summary pipelines. The pipeline manager is responsible for managing user requests and dynamically configuring functional pipelines for both search indexing and summarization.

The VLM, LLM, and Embedding microservices are provided as part of Intel Edge AI inference microservices catalog supporting a rich set of open-source models that can be downloaded from popular model hubs like [Hugging Face OpenVINO](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO). The video ingestion microservice provides capability to ingest common video formats, chunk the video, feed the extracted frames to configurable capabilities like object detection, and provide the output to both the VLM microservice for captioning and the embedding microservice for search indexing. The individual captions are then summarized by the LLM microservice to provide the final summary, while simultaneously being converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database for semantic search. The audio transcription microservice provides ability to transcribe the audio using Whisper model, contributing to both summary generation and search capabilities. An object store is used to save the raw videos, frames, and generated metadata, while a vector database stores the embeddings for fast semantic search.

### Application Flow
The application flow involves the following steps for both search indexing and summarization:

1. **Create the video search and summary pipeline**
   - **Configure the pipeline**: The _video search and summary UI microservice_ provides the user a means to configure the different capabilities required on both search and summary pipelines. A separate user guide is planned to provide all required details on how to setup the pipeline.
   - **Create the pipeline**: The configuration done on the UI is received by the _Video search and summary pipeline manager microservice_. The pipeline manager configures the required microservices as per the capabilities and configuration requested by the user.    
2. **Input Video Sources**:
   - **Provide video**: The user provides the source of the video to be processed for both search indexing and summarization. The UI provides means to configure the input video. Currently, only offline video processing is supported by reading from local storage. In future, live camera streaming support will also be provided. The pipeline manager stores the video into a local object store.
   - **Ingest video**: The stored video is then consumed by the _video ingestion microservice_. The video ingestion microservice reuses DL Streamer pipeline server and all its capabilities to provide for different features like object detection, audio classification, and (in future) input feed from live cameras. The ingestion process involves decode, chunking, and selection of frame(s) from the input video. The extracted frame(s) is passed through object detection blocks, audio classification block if they are configured. The extracted frames along with the metadata returned by the object detector and/or audio classification is then passed to both the VLM microservice for captioning and the embedding microservice for search indexing.
   - **Audio transcription**: The video is demuxed and audio extracted for transcription. Using the object store, the audio is fed to the _Audio transcription microservice_ and transcription is created. This transcription is used to feed to both the caption generation process and embedding creation for search, as well as stored in the object store for later stage processing.
3. **Create Caption for given frame(s) and Generate Embeddings**
   - **VLM microservice**: The extracted frame(s) along with the prompt and metadata returned from the object detector and/or audio classification is passed to the _vlm-ov-serving_ for captioning. Depending on the configuration and compute availability, batch captioning is also supported. To optimize for performance, the captioning is done in parallel with the video ingestion.
   - **Embedding generation**: Simultaneously,  generated captions and metadata are processed by the _multimodal embedding microservice_ to create vector representations that enable semantic search. These embeddings are stored in a vector database and indexed for fast retrieval.
   - **VLM model selection**: The capability of the VLM microservice is dependent on the VLM model used. Example, multi-frame caption by maintaining a context between frames is a function of the chosen model. In addition, the prompt passed has a significant implication on the quality of the output of the VLM.
   - **Store the captions and embeddings**: The generated captions along with all the metadata generated in the pipeline is stored in a local object store. During store, necessary relationship information between the stored data is also maintained. Concurrently, the embeddings are stored in the vector database with proper indexing for search functionality.
4. **Create summary of all captions**:
   - **LLM microservice**: After all the captions are generated, the _LLM microservice_ is used to create a summary of all individual captions. The selection of LLM model has an impact on the accuracy of the summary created.
5. **Enable semantic search capabilities**:
   - **Search functionality**: Once embeddings are created and stored, users can perform semantic searches across the entire video collection using natural language queries. The search system matches user queries against the stored embeddings to find semantically similar video content.
   - **Unified interface**: The UI provides both summary viewing and search capabilities, allowing users to discover relevant videos through search and then view their summaries.
6. **Observability dashboard**: 
   - If set up, the dashboard displays real-time logs, metrics, and traces providing a view of the performance, accuracy, and resource consumption by the application..
