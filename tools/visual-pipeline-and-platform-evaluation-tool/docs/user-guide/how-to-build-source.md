# Build from Source

Build the ViPPET (Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool) from source to customize, debug, or extend its functionality. In this guide, you will:
- Set up your development environment.
- Compile the source code and resolve dependencies.
- Generate a runnable build for local testing or deployment.

This guide is ideal for developers who want to work directly with the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
- **System Requirements**: Verify your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- **Dependencies Installed**:
    - **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Permissions**: Confirm you have permissions to install software and modify environment configurations.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands, Python virtual environments, and terminal usage. If you are new to these concepts, see:
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)


## Steps to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
     cd ./edge-ai-libraries/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool
     ```

2. **Build and Start the Tool**:
   - Set the appropriate device type (CPU, GPU, or NPU) and run the following command:
     ```bash
     make build run DEVICE_TYPE=<CPU/GPU/NPU>
     ```


## Validation

1. **Verify Build Success**:
   - Check the logs. Look for confirmation messages indicating the microservice started successfully.
2. **Access the Microservice**:
   - Open a browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:7860/?__theme=light
     ```
   - Expected result: The microserviceâ€™s UI loads successfully.


## Troubleshooting

1. **Environment Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify environment variables:
     ```bash
     echo $VARIABLE_NAME
     ```
