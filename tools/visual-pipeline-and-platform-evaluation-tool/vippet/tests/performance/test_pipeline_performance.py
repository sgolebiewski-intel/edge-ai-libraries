    is stopped on a best-effort basis and we poll briefly for confirmation
    (:func:`_confirm_job_stopped`) so the backend's single job slot is
    freed before the next attempt is submitted. Because that confirmation
    is best-effort, a 409 from submitting the next attempt is still
    possible; it is caught here and reported as a synthetic ``CONFLICT``
