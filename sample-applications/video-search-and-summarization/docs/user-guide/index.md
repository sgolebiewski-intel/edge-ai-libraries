Use the Video Search and Summarization (VSS) sample application to search through your videos, summarize them, and more.

This foundational sample application provides three modes:

| Mode | Use To | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 Video Search ([overview](./overview-search.md) and [architecture](./overview-architecture-search.md)) | Find specific content within large video datasets through natural language. | Extract and index visual, audio, and textual features from video frames using the LangChain framework, multimodal embedding models, and agentic reasoning. Query using natural language or multi-modal models. |
| 📝 Video Summarization ([overview](./overview-summary.md) and [architecture](./overview-architecture-summary.md)) | Create concise summaries of long-form videos or live streams, automatically. | Improve searchability. Combine insights from different data types using Generative AI Vision Language Models (VLMs), computer vision, and audio analysis. |
| 🔗 Combined Video Search and Summarization ([overview](./overview-search-and-summary.md) and [architecture](./overview-architecture-search-and-summary.md)) | Find specific content and create concise summaries of videos - ideal for a comprehensive video analysis. | Search quickly and directly over generated video summaries. Using the summary as a knowledge base makes the search results more relevant and accurate. |
