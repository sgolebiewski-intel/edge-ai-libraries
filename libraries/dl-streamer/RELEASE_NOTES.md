You might need to start again... and checking the setup on your HOST. I'm using Ubuntu 22.04LTS. Created a non-root-user. Adding the user to video and render groups. Installed docker and configured to use Docker as non-root (without using "sudo" when using "docker run"). Before starting the container, I just call xhost +. Passing the render-group-id to "docker run" (in my case `--group-add=110`) `docker run -it --net=host --device=/dev/dri --device=/dev/video0 --device=/dev/video1 --group-add=110 -v ~/.Xauthority:/home/dlstreamer/.Xauthority -v /tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /dev/bus/usb dlstreamer /bin/bash` (not using `-u 0 --privileged`)  | All |
