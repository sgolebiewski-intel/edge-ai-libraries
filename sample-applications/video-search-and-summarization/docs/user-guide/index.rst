# Video Search and Summary (VSS)

Video Search and Summarization (VSS) is a foundational sample application that provides
video analytics, using a combination of different AI models. It offers three distinct modes
in which its capabilities can be utilized:

- Video Search (:doc:`overview <./overview-search>` | :doc:`architecture <./overview-architecture-search.md>`)
- Video Summary (:doc:`overview <./overview-summary.md>` | :doc:`architecture <./overview-architecture-summary.md>`)
- Video Search and Summary
