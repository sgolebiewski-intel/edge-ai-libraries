# GPU ORB Extractor Feature Overview

This repository provides tutorials and usage guides for the GPU ORB Extractor Feature, supporting both OpenCV-based and OpenCV-free workflows. The GPU ORB Extractor library enables fast, thread-safe keypoint extraction for visual SLAM and computer vision applications, with support for multiple cameras and multi-threaded processing.

## Features

- High-performance GPU-accelerated ORB keypoint extraction
- Supports both OpenCV (`cv::Mat`, `cv::KeyPoint`) and OpenCV-free data structures
- Thread-safe API for multi-camera and multi-threaded use cases
- Flexible configuration for single or multiple ORB extractor objects

## Quick Start

Refer to the GPU ORB Extractor Feature Overview page for more details on the pre-requisites.
