GPU ORB extractor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The library demonstrates ORB feature extractor running using CPU and GPU. The ORB
feature extractor is based on OpenVSLAM version.

https://github.com/OpenVSLAM-Community/openvslam

This ORB can easily integrate to Visual SLAM.  After initializing orb_extractor object,
for every input frame, call to extract function.  Extract function will return a set of
keypoints and descriptors.

The ORB feature extractor consists of various CV kernels such as resize, gaussian,
fast, compute descriptor and orientation while non CV functions like distribute_keypoints_via_tree.

All the CV related kernels have offloaded to Intel GPU using oneAPI Level Zero interface
and GPU kernels are written using C-for-Metal.  Non CV functions will run in CPU.

System Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04
2) OpenCV 4.2
   Currently the library only support OpenCV 4.0-4.2, > 4.2 is not supported due to cv::Mat change
3) Intel level zero runtime driver

1) include  -  Class header that provides configurable options for this library
2) lib - Host code libgpu_orb.so and all *.bin are compiled GPU kernels.
3) samples - Samples code to show how to use the library for either mono camera or stereo camera.


Build and run sample code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd samples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j8
```
### Run the sample
./feature_extract


Additional option
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Adjusting for latency and CPU util
export CPU_SLEEP_TIME=<sleep duration in microseconds>
# Higher sleep value leads to higher latency & reduced CPU util and vice versa
