# Video Search and Summary (VSS)

Video Search and Summarization (VSS) is a foundational sample application that provides
video analytics, using a combination of different AI models. It offers three distinct modes
in which its capabilities can be utilized:

- Video Search ([overview](./overview-search.md) | [architecture](./overview-architecture-search.md))
- Video Summary ([overview](./overview-summary.md) | [architecture](./overview-architecture-summary.md))
- Video Search and Summary ([overview](./overview-search-and-summary.md) | [architecture](./overview-architecture-search-and-summary.md))
