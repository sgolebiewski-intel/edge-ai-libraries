RTmotion Library
================

RTmotion is a library designed to match the interfaces and functions of the function blocks defined in PLCopen standard. It is not tied to any operating system, fieldbus, SoftPLC or applications. But it needs to run in a real-time thread to have steady cycle and gain maximum performance. So the real-time operating systems are the base foundation for RTmotion to run on.
