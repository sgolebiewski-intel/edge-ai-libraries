# How to Build from Source

Build the Model Registry from source to customize, debug, or extend its functionality. In this guide, you will:
- Set up your development environment.
- Compile the source code and resolve dependencies.
- Generate a runnable build for local testing or deployment.

This guide is ideal for developers who want to work directly with the source code.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
- **System Requirements**: Verify your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- **Dependencies Installed**:
    - **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - **Python 3.8 or higher**: [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Permissions**: Confirm you have permissions to install software and modify environment configurations.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands, Python virtual environments, and terminal usage. If you are new to these concepts, see:
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)


## Steps to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries -b release-1.2.0
    cd edge-ai-libraries/
    ```

2. **Install Python 3.10**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3.10
    ```
3. **Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`**
    ```bash
    cd microservices/model-registry/docker
    mv .env.template .env
    ```
4. **Create the directories to be used as persistent storage for the `PostgreSQL` and `MinIO` containers**
    ```bash
    # Note: The path below is relative to the path specified in step 3.
    cd ../scripts
    sudo ./init_mr_data_dirs.sh
    ```

5. **Define the desired values for the REQUIRED environment variables in the `.env` file in the `docker` directory:**
    1. `MR_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`
    2. `MR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY`
    3. `MR_PSQL_PASSWORD`

    ```bash
    # Note: The path below is relative to the path specified in step 4.
    cd ../docker
    vi .env
    ```

    * For more information about the supported the environment variables, refer to the [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md) documentation.

1. Optional: Enter values for the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` variables in the `.env` file if you are behind a proxy.
    ```
    http_proxy= # example: http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:891
    https_proxy= # example: https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:891
    ```

1. **Load the environment variables defined in the `.env` file into the current Terminal session**
    ```bash
    source .env
    ```
    
1. **Build the model registry and start the containers**
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Validation

1. **Verify Build Success**:
   - Check the logs. Look for confirmation messages indicating the microservice started successfully.

2. **Access the Microservice**:
   - Open a browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:{{port}}/docs
     ```
   - Expected result: The microserviceâ€™s API documentation page loads successfully.
   
   For more example requests and their responses, refer to the [Get Started Guide](./get-started.md#storing-a-model-in-the-registry).

## Troubleshooting

1. **Dependency Installation Errors**:
   - Reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Environment Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify environment variables:
     ```bash
     echo $VARIABLE_NAME
     ```
